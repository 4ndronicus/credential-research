# Description #

As time goes on, there are more and more credential dumps appearing online.  There are databases from LinkedIn, Adobe, MySpace, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, and many others.  In an effort to understand peoples' password habits, I am importing them into my own database.  From there, I can answer questions like the following:

What are the most common passwords?
How much password reuse occurs?
Can a good password list be generated from these databases?
Can I generate hashes from these databases to test for weak passwords?

This repository will contain statistics from each of the database dumps that I analyze.  As I answer each of the questions listed above and others, I will post the results of that research here.

# Results #

Here are the top 1 Million most common passwords of each data dump.
